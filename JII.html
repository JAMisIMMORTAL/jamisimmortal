		<h2>A Little Bit About JAM</h2>
		<p>I'm Juan Antonio Mendoza, also known as JAM! I have been writing lyrics and poems for a decade as a form of self-reflection. Initially I refused to show anyone due to my timid nature, but I realized that my love for music was more than an appreciation, but a passion. I am driven not by fame, but a need to better understand myself while exploring the beautiful world of creation.

		My hope is that someone will connect to one of my songs, making its creation worth something more than what it means to me.
